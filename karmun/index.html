		<h1>Why Renewable Energy Sources</h1>
		<div id="intro-container">
			<p class="quoteline">Today, the most prevalent sources of energy on the planet are fossil fuels. However, our reserves of these resources are limited, and according to some estimates, they are close to being depleted. If that happens, the world, including Europe, will have to face an energy crisis. This website was created to discuss potential alternatives to these non renewable energy sources, detailing their strengths and weaknesses compared to fossil fuels, and thus provide useful information for Karmun participants about the issue of the Energy Crisis in Europe.</p>

				<p>Solar energy is energy that is generated by the sun. This energy can be converted into electricity by using solar panels, which are made up of photovoltaic cells that absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity. Solar energy can also be used directly for heating and cooling buildings or water through the use of solar thermal systems, which absorb sunlight and use it to heat water or air. Solar energy is a renewable source of energy that produces no emissions, making it a clean source of energy.</p>
