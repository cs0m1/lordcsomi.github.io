Hi!  I am a student in Karinthy Frigyes Gimn√°zium from Hungary. I just started learning HTML and I am currently learning how to use GitHub and git to manage my projects. Also I got access to github copilot and I am still learning it.
So here is my little website. Good bye for now and wish me luck!
